Que--> Diffrence between logical AND and Logical OR
Ans-->In logical AND it is going to check both the conditions if first condition comes true for the exection whereas in Logical OR it is going to check got first condition if it comes false then it is going to check for second condition

1. keywords --> keywords are the reserved words whose meaning is already been explained to the language compiled.
2. Identifiers --> Name of any variable, class, function or and another thing in the language.

Rules for Identifying a Identifier
-->cannot start with a number
-->identifiers consist of alphabete(a-z A-Z), Numbers(0-9), and Underscore(_) {we are able to use $ in Java}

3. DataTypes--> DataType tell the type of Data that we are going to store in the Memory and for storing the data how much memory is required.
Built in DataTypes:
    int 
    float 
    char 
    double 
    bool 
    string
User Defined DataTypes:
    class
    Stucture
    Functions
Drived DataTypes
    Array
    Pointer
Empty DataTypes
    void

4. variables-->It is a Container that is used to store data. It is a Name Location in the menory that are used to hold a value
syntax for variable:--> StorageClass DataType variableName.
storageClass-> defines the scope and visibility of the variable

int main(){
    int x = 10,20,30,40;
    cout<<x;
    return 0;
}
What is th output of the following Code:
Ans-> Compilation Error
int main(){
    int x = (10,20,30,40);
    cout<<x;
    return 0;
}
Ans-> x=40 
as in this code multiple values are going to assigned to x hence the latest value is the value of x ehich is 40

int main(){
    int x
    x = 10,20,30,40;
    cout<<x;
    return 0;
}
No Error th compiler assign 10 value to the x because in this case the x is inilatixe first then assigned the value rathar than assigning the value while initalizing


Integer Literal --> a+52
Floating Literal --> a+4.5
Character Literal --> a + aman
String Literal -->  a + 'h'

constant Variables--> The variables which we are not going to change at the time of the execution. To make the variable constant we will use const keywords

    int const x=10;
    cout<<x;
    return 0;

    output--> 10

short int      :2byte  
int            :4byte //depend on compiler to compiler
long int       :4byte
long long int  :8byte

Operators --> operators are used to preform mathemetical and logical operations in the program.

Post-Increment--> menas first assign the non-incremented value of a variable to the expression and then increase the value of the variable by one in the memory.
Pre-Increment--> menas first increase the value of the variable by one in the memory and then assign the incremented value to the variable.
